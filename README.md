# MitoCube

Welcome to the MitoCube repository, *feature-data* fork. **MitoCube** (/myto'cube/) is a Python Online database tool for proteomic lovers 
of mass spectrometryâ€“based quantitative experiments .

> Current fork is not ready for productive system. 

## Installation

Please visit the (Installation help website)[https://app.mitocube.com/help/installation] to install MitoCube. The 
following documentation highlights deviations for the configuration / installation of the master version only.

### .env environment file

An `.env` file from the python-decouple package is used to handles credential for the installation. `.env` files are 
not pushed to the repository and one should not save credentials in any other file. First create the file by ...

```Shell
sudo nano .env
```

... and entering the following configurations.

```INI
email-admin=aliquis@aliquo.eu
pw-admin=quispiam
email-pw=quispiam
mitocube-pw=quispiam
global-pw=quispiam
```

Next one requires to define the data handler (`db-handler`) in `.env`. The `db-handler=pandafiles` is based on the 
legacy implementation and requires the variables `db-datadir` and `db-featurefile` to define the path of the datasets 
and the feature database file.

```INI
db-handler=pandafiles
db-datadir=~/mitocube/backend/data/static/datasets
db-featurefile=~/mitocube/backend/data/static/dbs/uniprot/features.txt
```

Alternatively, the `db-handler=postgresql` is available to store all data in the PostgreSQL  database 
(https://www.postgresql.org). The variables `db-ip`, `ddb-name`, `db-user` and `db-pw` are required.

```INI
db-handler=postgresql
db-ip=127.0.0.1
db-name=MitoCube
db-user=quispiam
db-pw=quispiam
```

### PostgreSQL database 

The database can be setup using the SQL statements in `setup_empty_postgresql_20230418.sql` found in the 
`/backend/resources/data/setup/` directory. `/backend/resources/data/` will include scripts to create the initial data
structure, but also to import existing data saved in the `/backend/data/` directories into the database.

### Apache

Apache is configured as forward proxy for the FLASK backend `http://0.0.0.0/api/`. The build of the frontend is served 
via *DocumentRoot*. 

```INI
<Directory /srv/httpd/mitocube>
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
   AllowOverride None
   Require all granted
</Directory>
```

For the forward proxy, these four modules needs to be enabled in Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_balancer lbmethod_byrequests
```

On Windows system, modules are enabled by uncommenting the following lines in the `httpd.conf`.

```INI
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mode_proxy_connect.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_ssl.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_xml2enc.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy_html.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy_http2.so
```

The forward proxy is configured as Virtual host in the configuration file. Only use IP addresses to minimise 
response times.

```INI
<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerAdmin aliquis@aliquo.eu
   DocumentRoot /srv/httpd/mitocube

   ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
   CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

   ProxyPreserveHost On
   ProxyPass /api http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
   ProxyPassReverse /api http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
</VirtualHost>
```

## Changelog *feature-data* fork

The goal for the *feature-data* fork is to upgrade the backend to support additional data management systems such as
PostgreSQL.


### version 2022-04-24

The current *preliminary* (!) implementation is proof-of-concept and allows to switch MitoCube between the 
legacy system and an PostgreSQL DBMS, but it is limited to a fixed number of datasets and does not implement the master 
version to 100% yet

#### Changes compared to master (2022-04-24)
* Created new `/backend/lib/` directory for logic content
* Moved `/backend/resources/` to `/backend/lib/oldresources/`
* Using `/backend/resources/` for resources such as setup, data import and automation scripts
* Added Data `Old*` prefix to classes in `Data.py` (e.g. *OldData*, *OldDataset*, ...)
* Added `JSONSerializable` Interface (*ABC*) in `/backend/lib/DesignPatterns.py`
* Added `SingletonABCMeta` Class (*ABCMeta*) in `/backend/lib/DesignPatterns.py`
* Added `SingletonMeta` Class () in `/backend/lib/DesignPatterns.py`
* Added abstract `MitoCubeDatabase(SingletonABCMeta)` as new `Data` Handler in `/backend/lib/DataHandling.py`
* Added abstract `MitoCubeDataCollection()` as new `DatasetCollection` in `/backend/lib/DataHandling.py`
* Added abstract `MitoCubeDataset()` as new `Dataset` in `/backend/lib/DataHandling.py`
* Added abstract `MitoCubeAbundanceTable(JSONSerializable)` as new class to handle abundance data of a `Dataset` in `/backend/lib/DataHandling.py`
* Added abstract `MitoCubeMetaInformation(JSONSerializable)` as new class to handle meta information of a `Dataset`  in `/backend/lib/DataHandling.py`
* Added abstract `MitoCubeFeatures()` implementation of `DBFeatures` in `/backend/lib/DataHandling.py`
* Added abstract `SQLConnection(SingletonABCMeta)`
* Implemented legacy file support in `/backend/lib/data/PandaFileHandly.py` by implementing abstract classes in `DataHandling.py`
* Implemented PostgreSQL support in `/backend/lib/data/PostgreSQLHandly.py` by implementing abstract classes in `DataHandling.py`
* Added UML diagrams in `/backend/config/docs/diagrams/`

#### Currently missing implementation (2022-04-24)

* Added `Token`, `PandaFileToken`, `PostgreSQLTocken` Classes in `/backend/lib/security/Token.py`
* *PTM* not implemented in Data classes yet
* Implementations of `DataHandling.py` classes are currently integrated in the old classes (*OldData*, *OldDataset*, etc.), and are hold in memory on start of the application. Currently not more than 42 datasets are loaded from the PostgreSQL database.

##### Upcoming Changes (2022-04-24)
* Swap data access via old `Data.py` classes to new `DataHandling.py` classes.
* Implement `Token` classes to support new data handler
* Implement Cache function for `PandaFileDatabase` in `PandaFileHandly.py`
* Implement Data Upload support
* Implement QC support
* Add import scripts for version migration and automation.
* Change current database structure to include tags and more meta text for data support information.
* Implement new User handling with File and PostgreSQL support.
* Create new `/lib/data/stat` directory for statistics
* Outsource statistical routines in `Data.py` and others to new statistic classes
* Streamline existing data processing routines 
* Streamline data submission forms
* Import metadata at upload from file names or other files (such as from instruments / other software)
